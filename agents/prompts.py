"""Prompt builder utilities for `RetailCustomerServiceAgent` and related LLM-based agents.

The functions in this module **only** format the user-visible parts of prompts so they are
reusable from multiple call-sites.  System instructions or model parameters remain in the
calling functions because they may vary depending on the agent's configuration.

All builders return **plain strings** â€“ they do *not* include any role metadata so the
caller is free to place them into either the `system` or `user` role as appropriate.

        2. If the message uses phrases like "my order", "the order", "my recent purchase", "it" (clearly referring to an order) AND only ONE recent order ID is in the list, return that single recent order ID.
        3. If the message uses phrases like "my order", etc., AND MULTIPLE recent order IDs are in the list, return "ambiguous".
        4. If the message seems to mention an order ID but it's NOT in the recent list provided, return "not_recent".
        5. If no order is mentioned or clearly inferable from the context and recent orders, return "not_found".

        - If multiple products are mentioned, return the primary one being asked about.
        - If the message is about a general topic (like orders, returns, store hours) and not a specific product, return "not_found".
