# Welcome to Agentic Retail Foundations

This project provides a modular, extensible framework and foundational code examples for building, simulating, and analyzing agent-based AI architectures for retail.

It includes implementations of various agent types, communication protocols, decision-making frameworks, and supporting data models relevant to retail operations like inventory management, procurement, customer service, and fulfillment.
