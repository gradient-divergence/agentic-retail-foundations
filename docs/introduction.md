# Introduction to Agentic Retail Foundations

Welcome to the **Agentic Retail Foundations** project! This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit and learning resource for developers, researchers, and architects interested in building sophisticated multi-agent systems (MAS) tailored for the retail industry.

## What is Agentic Retail?

Agentic retail leverages autonomous AI agents—software entities capable of perception, reasoning, decision-making, and action—to automate and optimize various aspects of retail operations. These agents can collaborate, negotiate, and adapt to dynamic market conditions, customer behaviors, and supply chain events.

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

1.  **Provide Foundational Code:** Offer well-structured, reusable Python code for core agent components, communication protocols (like FIPA, CNP, Auctions), data models (Pydantic/Dataclasses), and decision-making frameworks (RL, Bayesian, Causal Inference).
2.  **Demonstrate Key Concepts:** Illustrate complex MAS patterns through clear examples and interactive Marimo notebooks covering topics like:
    *   Agent Architectures (BDI, OODA)
    *   Coordination Protocols (Contract Net, Auctions, Inventory Sharing)
    *   Decision-Making (Q-Learning, Bayesian Recommendations, Causal ROI)
    *   Cross-Functional Collaboration (Product Launch Orchestration)
    *   Supporting Technologies (Event Sourcing, API Gateways, CRDTs)
3.  **Enable Simulation & Analysis:** Facilitate the simulation of agent interactions and the analysis of system-level outcomes.
4.  **Serve as a Learning Resource:** Act as an educational tool for understanding the practical implementation of agentic AI in retail.
