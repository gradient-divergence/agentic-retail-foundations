        # Chapter 1: Introduction

        In this chapter, we explore what makes AI "agentic," transitioning from traditional methods to autonomous decision-making systems. 

        We'll discuss foundational concepts, the AI lifecycle, and the essential building blocks that position agentic AI as a transformative force in retail. 

        Readers will gain clarity on how proactive intelligence reshapes inventory management, pricing, and customer experiences, setting the stage for deeper exploration in subsequent chaptersâ€‹.

        **Explanation:** This agent checks a product's stock each day and autonomously decides to place a reorder when stock falls below a threshold. 

        After acting, it updates its internal stock state. (In a real scenario, learning could be implemented to adjust the reorder threshold or predict optimal order quantities over time.)
